class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        int[] dp=new int[n+1];
        dp[n]=1;
        for(int i=n-1;i>=0;i--)
        {
            if(i==n-1)
                dp[n-1]=dp[n];
            else{
                dp[i]=dp[i+1]+dp[i+2];
            }
        }
        return dp[0];
    }
